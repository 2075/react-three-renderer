# TODO for this document (how meta can it get? :D)
- [ ] How is the code organized?
- [ ] Where do I start to understand how the code works? (Which file? Helpful articles?)
  - This is important because of the highly custom nature of this library, it's completely different from most other react libraries
- [ ] What does a complete PR look like? (Documentation, code, tests, etc.)
- [ ] How do I generate documentation?
- [ ] How do I write tests?
  - [ ] Where do tests go?
  - [ ] Can I see an example?
- [ ] How do I contribute to the wiki?
  - [ ] Do I fork or use the Edit button?
  - [ ] Can I view my changes locally?
  - [ ] How does the wiki work?
  - [ ] Is it automatically generated?
  - [ ] Is the wiki folder uploaded somewhere or does GitHub actually support that?
